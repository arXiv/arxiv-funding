# arXiv funding

# THIS IS A SKELETAL FLASK PROJECT, there is no useful code here.

## Problem 

Information about funding sources associated with scientific outputs (including
arXiv e-prints) is increasingly in demand, e.g. for compliance with 
open access mandates. The core metadata model for arXiv does not support 
funding information. We want to both minimize changes to the 
canonical record, but also allow for a variety of workflows for adding funding
information. This project introduces a new service that can accession and make
available funding information about specific arXiv e-prints.

## Requirements

1. Author-owners can add/edit funding information about their e-prints. They
   should be able to enter/select an agency, a grant/award number, and 
   possibly other information about the grant.

   - The CrossRef funder registry should be leveraged to the greatest extent
     possible. https://www.crossref.org/services/funder-registry/

2. Readers can view funding information for specific e-prints.
3. Provide a RESTful JSON API that allows authorized clients to add/edit
   funding information.

   - Author-owner delegate via OAuth2 workflow.
   - Client owned by the author-owner.
   - Other authorized client, e.g. internal arXiv system client.

4. Provide a RESTful JSON API that supports:

  - Retrieve funding information for a specific e-print.
  - Retrieve e-prints associated with a particular funding agency and/or award.

5. Publishes system notifications (via Kinesis) about new funding information.


## Quick-start

We use [Pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) for dependency management.

```bash
pipenv install --dev
```

You can run either the API or the UI using the Flask development server.

```bash
FLASK_APP=ui.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 pipenv run flask run
```

Dockerfiles are also provided in the root of this repository. These use uWSGI and the
corresponding ``wsgi_[xxx].py`` entrypoints.
